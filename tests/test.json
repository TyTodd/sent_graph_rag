This cycle includes processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, runoff, and subsurface flow. Water evaporates from oceans, lakes, and rivers due to solar energy. This vapor then condenses to form clouds, which eventually lead to precipitation in the form of rain or snow. Some of the precipitation infiltrates the ground and replenishes groundwater, while the rest flows over the land as runoff and returns to bodies of water. The water cycle is essential for sustaining life on Earth by distributing fresh water, regulating temperature, and supporting plant growth. Human activities like deforestation and urbanization can disrupt this natural cycle by affecting infiltration and increasing runoff. Climate change is also altering precipitation patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, making understanding the water cycle more important than ever.",

      "context": "Democracy is a system of government in which power is vested in the people, typically through elected representatives. In a democratic society, citizens have the right to vote, express their opinions, and participate in decision-making processes. The core principles of democracy include majority rule, protection of minority rights, the rule of law, and the separation of powers. Modern democracies often feature checks and balances among branches of government to prevent the abuse of power. The ancient city of Athens is credited with developing one of the earliest forms of democracy. Today, democratic systems vary widely, from presidential to parliamentary models. While democracy promotes accountability and civil liberties, it requires active participation and a well-informed electorate to function effectively.",

      "context": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. AI systems are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing speech, translating languages, playing games, and making decisions. AI can be classified into narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, and general AI, which would perform any intellectual task a human can do. Recent advancements in machine learning, especially deep learning, have led to major breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles. While AI presents numerous opportunities, it also raises concerns about ethics, bias, job displacement, and control. Responsible development includes fairness, transparency, and alignment with human values.",

      "context": "The nervous system is the body\u2019s communication network, responsible for transmitting signals between different parts of the body. It is divided into the central nervous system (CNS), comprising the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which includes all other neural elements. The brain processes sensory information and controls voluntary and involuntary actions. Neurons, the functional units of the nervous system, transmit electrical impulses via synapses. The spinal cord acts as a conduit for messages between the brain and body. Reflex actions occur when signals bypass the brain, enabling quick responses. Disorders of the nervous system include multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and epilepsy. Proper functioning is essential for coordination, perception, thought, and movement.",
